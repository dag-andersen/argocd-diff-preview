# Try demo locally with 3 simple commands!

First, make sure Docker is running. Run `docker ps` to check if it's running.

Second, run the following 3 commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dag-andersen/argocd-diff-preview base-branch --depth 1 -q 

git clone https://github.com/dag-andersen/argocd-diff-preview target-branch --depth 1 -q -b helm-example-3

docker run \
   --network host \
   -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
   -v $(pwd)/output:/output \
   -v $(pwd)/base-branch:/base-branch \
   -v $(pwd)/target-branch:/target-branch \
   -e TARGET_BRANCH=helm-example-3 \
   -e REPO=dag-andersen/argocd-diff-preview \
   dagandersen/argocd-diff-preview:v0.2.2
```

and the output would be something like this:

```
