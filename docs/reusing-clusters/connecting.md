# Connecting to a cluster with Argo CD pre-installed

![](../assets/reusing-cluster-from-outside.png)

Instead of spinning up an ephemeral cluster for each diff preview, you can connect to a cluster with Argo CD already installed. This saves approximately `60`‚Äì`90` seconds per run.

**Important:** We highly recommend **not** using your production Argo CD instance for rendering manifests. Instead, install a dedicated Argo CD instance for diff previews.

The Argo CD server does not need to be exposed to the internet, since `argocd-diff-preview` connects via a KubeConfig file (or service account).

To use this feature, mount a valid KubeConfig with access to the cluster and provide these options:

```bash
--create-cluster false --argocd-namespace <namespace>
```

This will skip cluster creation and connect to Argo CD via port-forwarding in the specified namespace.

## Requirements

- The default `admin` user must not be disabled in Argo CD.
- The `default` Argo CD project must exist.
- The required secrets for authentication have already been added to the cluster.

## Example Demo

### _Step 1_: Create cluster (skip if you already have a cluster with Argo CD installed)
```bash
kind create cluster
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm install argo-cd argo/argo-cd --version 8.0.3 --create-namespace --namespace argocd-diff-preview
```

```bash
# Wait for Argo CD to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server -n argocd-diff-preview
```

### _Step 2_: Clone the base and target branches
```bash
# Clone the base branch into a subfolder called `base-branch`
git clone https://github.com/dag-andersen/argocd-diff-preview base-branch --depth 1 -q 

# Clone the target branch into a subfolder called `target-branch`
git clone https://github.com/dag-andersen/argocd-diff-preview target-branch --depth 1 -q -b helm-example-3
```

### _Step 3_: Run the tool

Make sure you:
- Mount the KubeConfig into the container (`-v ~/.kube:/root/.kube`)
- Disable cluster creation (`--create-cluster=false`)
- Specify the Argo CD namespace (`--argocd-namespace=<ns>`)

```bash
docker run \
  --network host \
  -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/output \
  -v $(pwd)/base-branch:/base-branch \
  -v $(pwd)/target-branch:/target-branch \
  -e TARGET_BRANCH=helm-example-3 \
  -e REPO=dag-andersen/argocd-diff-preview \
  dagandersen/argocd-diff-preview:v0.1.19 \
  --argocd-namespace=argocd-diff-preview \
  --create-cluster=false
```

And then the output will look something like this:

## Authenticate with Cloud Providers

If you're connecting to a cluster on a cloud provider, you often use a plugin or [ExecConfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubeconfig.v1/#ExecConfig) to authenticate (for example, `kubelogin` for Azure AKS or `aws eks get-token` for AWS EKS).

You can check this by running `kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{.users[*].user}'` and looking for the `command` field.

These plugins/binaries are **not** available inside the Docker image, so you'll need to run `argocd-diff-preview` as a standalone binary.

You can find installation instructions in the [docs](../getting-started/installation.md#__tabbed_1_2).
